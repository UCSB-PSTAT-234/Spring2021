# PSTAT 234: Group Final Project Description

The final project for this class will be to work on a "real" data science project with an interdisciplinary team. 

The project should be motivated by a relevant domain question or goal that can be tackled with (real or simulated) data-driven quantitative/computational analysis. The project topic can confirm a known pattern/phenomenon from a different data source or using a different quantitative method.

The goal for the project is to scope and experience an interdisciplinary data science project from end-to-end including packaging and presenting it.

Here is a plan for how the project component will work for this class.

## Project Pitch

If you have a project idea, prepare a short video pitch (15 minutes max.) about your project idea. Make sure to address the following aspects:
* **Context**: give a concise context for what your research is about and its relevance. Be mindful of your audience that may not share the same domain expertise as you. Use plain language as much as possible or define any essential domain specific terminology.
* **Research question/Project goal**: be concise and specific as possible. Tie it back to the importance of the project in terms of the context and the potential impact. Given the time constraint of the class, it may be necessary to carve out a concrete and feasible sub-problem. 
* **Dataset**: discuss the data source and the relevance of it for achieving the research goal. What are the challenges? What would be fun and exciting?

Be mindful of data sensitivity/privacy/ethics and plan on crediting your team if the project is related to your dissertation research. If there is limitation on data-use and/or other restrictions on sharing your team's work product with rest of the class, I am open to discussing and addressing them.

## Logistics

* **Project Teams**: each project team is to be four members from at least two departments.
* **Computational tools**: the choice of programming languages (R or Python) and the use of other computational tools are left open for teams to choose.
* **Final Deliverables**: the group will be evaluated on the final presentation video and a file package. The **target audience** of your deliverables are other students in the class (generally technical but likely non domain experts in your project context).
    * **Video Presentation**: A good model for your presentations are TED talks that focus on delivery of a few key messages. 
    * **Reproducible File Package**: submit a reproducible file package (on GitHub) that contains your report (written version of your presentation) and other parts of the project that is essential but could not be included in the main report. Submitted files should be sufficient to recreate results from your report.
